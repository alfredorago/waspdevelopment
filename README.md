This repository includes the code used for the paper:

["Sex biased expression and co-expression networks in development, using the hymenopteran Nasonia vitripennis"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008518)

And is a large part of my PhD work.
I upload it as a form of record-keeping. 

I introduced version control very late in the process, 
and the workflow includes plenty of code that was not used in the final paper.

The final workflow is reported in the file [CCRE_workflow.txt](CCRE_workflow.txt)
