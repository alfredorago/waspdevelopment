CCRE based network analysis

Script workflow:

## exon_to_transcript_clustering_rankingonly_adjusted
splits transcriptionand splicing nodes
	
## CCREs singleblock
Normalizes data distribution and performs QC, generates t_nasdevgenexon dataset
Collapses groups of nodes with >95% correlation (biweight midcorrelation) 
Represents groups using most intraconnected node within it (highest connectivity with power 1)

## Sex biased nodes CCRE
Detects differential expression of nodes within CCRE network

## WGCNA_CCRE_Clustering_biweight
Creates static network from CCRE data

## DE cluster analysis CCRE
Uses differential expression on CCREs and Transcription/Splicing nodes

## Sex modularity biweight CCRE
Generates permuted data for modularity testing

## sex modularity GLMs CCRE
Generate modularity stats for CCRE clusters
Tests CCRE clusters for sex-linked changes in modularity

## Network Concepts Adj CCRE
Calculates within cluster network concepts for empirical CCRE network
full network comp start: 10 apr 22:00
fnc end: 14 apr 21:00

## w betweenness CCRE
(depends on file module_adj.RData generated by Network_Concepts_adj_CCRE)
Calculates global and within cluster node betweenness (possibly also between clusters)

## KME correction

## Network Concepts analysis
Plots within cluster network concepts for empirical CCRE network

## CCRE results compiler
Generate two tables:
transcript table: one row per transcript, used for cluster summaries and single-isoform analysis, listing CCRE assignments and representative node
node table: one row per node (transcript, isoform or CCRE) used for network summaries. Lists nodes assigned to each CCRE and CCRE size plus n of isoforms in it
